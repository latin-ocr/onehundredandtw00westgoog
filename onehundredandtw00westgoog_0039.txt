Zoilus aegrotat: faciunt hanc stragula febrem
Si fuerit sanus, coccina quid facient?

Quid torus a Nilo, quid Sidone tinctus olenti?
Ostendit stultas qnid nisi morbus opes? .

Quid tibi cum medicis? Dimitte Machaonas omnes. 5
Vis fieri sanus? Stragula sume mea.

Et cuius laxas arca flagellat opes. 10
