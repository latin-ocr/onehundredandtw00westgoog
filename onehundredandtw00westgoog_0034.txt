Engrmms of Martial.

Tam longe cst mihi quam Terentianus,
Qui nunc Niliacam regit Syenen.

Non convivere, nec videre saltim,

Non audire licet, nec urbe tota

Quisquam est tam prope tam proculque nobis. 5
Migrandum est mihi longius vel illi.

Vicinus Novio vel inquilinus
Sit, si quis Novium videre non vult.

My neighbor Hunks’s house and mine
Are built so near they almost join;

The wind0ws‚ too, project so much,
That through the casements we may touch.
Nay‚ I’m so happy, most men think,
To live so near a man ol chinh,

That they are apt to envy me,

For heeping such good company:

But he’s as lar from me, I vow,

As London is from good Lord Howe;
For when old Hunks I chance to meet,
Or one or both must quit the street,
Thus he who would not see old Roger,
Must be his neighbor or his lodger.

Swifl.
