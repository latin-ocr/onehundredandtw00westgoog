INTRODUCTlON.

'l Wrrrrrw a narrow range Martial possessed areally
3 creative genius. He brought to its highest perlection
ione form of poetry, and his work has been ever since
i the model and type of the epigram in all the litera-
} tures of the world, a model and type which have not
been surpassed in any literature.
ἑ ln i-t? original sense an epigram wasa mere inscrip
, tionupon some material object, such as a monument,
ἱ Q or a votive offering. ln its developed sense,
ἶ wa adopt Lessing’s definition and call it “ A poem
{which after the manner of a real inscription, our
· memnon and curiosity are excited toward some single
,³ phiectsand more or less held in suspense, in order to
' ' bg, suddenly gratilied.” ¹ It thus falls readily into two
parts: the first corresponding to the monument or
other material object, which arrests the attention and
l, arouses the curiosity 3 the second corresponding t0 the
. inscription by which that curiosity is satished. We
usually expect an epigram to be short. Nearly always,
il successful, it is witty, but it may be pathetic. The

conclusion must be pithy and-pointed.

' 1 lt is not pretended that this definition is in all respects satisfactory,
but it gives a fair idea oi the structure of Martial’s epigrams.
